Just playing around with implementing monads in Python.

There's also a little metaclass muckery thrown in for good measure!

Don't take it too seriously, this is just a toy project.

I was good enough to include a test suite though.


Quick Examples
--------------

Currently `Maybe`, `Either`, `List`, `Reader` and `Writer` are all 
implemented in either full or partial fashion. I've also included an 
applicative dictionary instance named `Map`.

`pynads` will also export `Reader` aliased to `Function` and `R`, but 
these resolve to the original Reader class.

###Putting values in Context

```python
Maybe.unit(4) # Returns Just(4)
```

Or use a functional approach:

```python
unit(4, Maybe)
```

Unit on other Monads:

```python
Either.unit(4)     # Right 4
List.unit(4)       # List 4
Writer.unit(4)     # Writer 4 List()
Map.unit(('a', 4)) # Map({'a': 4})
Reader.unit(4)     # Reader(const)
```

The `List` monad is also smart enough to differ between strings and mappings
and other types of iterables:

```python
List.unit("hello")   # List("hello")
List.unit({'a': 4})  # List({'a': 4})
List.unit([4, 5])    # List(4, 5)
```

`Reader`'s unit method puts a value into a closure that ignores any input
and returns the original value.

```Python
r = Reader.unit(4)
print(r(None)) # boom, 4 pops out!
```

###Bind, Shove, `>>=`, et. al

Use a bastardized version of Haskell's `>>=`:

```python
Just(4) >> (lambda v: Maybe(v+2))
```

Chain them together with excessive parens:

```python
Maybe.unit(4) >> (lambda v: v+2) >> (lambda v: Nothing)
```

Tired of guarding against Nones?

```python
from random import randint

def bad_get_int():
    x = randint(1,10)
    return x if x%2 else None

inc = lambda x: x+1

Maybe(bad_get_int()) >> inc >> inc
```

Now you can focus *what* your fail condition is, rather than how to handle it!


Use the bind assignment operator:
```python
m = Just(2)
m <<= lambda x: Just(x+2) # now it's Just 4
```

When using Reader and pulling from the environment is needed, nesting
lambdas is necessary, formatted for readability:

```python
>>> from operators import itemgetter as read
>>> from pynads import R # use Reader shortcut
>>> comp = R(read('a')) >> (lambda a:
           R(read('b')) >> (lambda b:
           R.unit(a+b)             ))
>>> comp({'a': 10, 'b': 7})
... 17
```

If you've got more binds than editor columns, you can use
`pynads.funcs.multibind` to chain them all together.

```python
from itertools import repeat
multibind(Just(0), *repeat(lambda x: Just(x+2), 3))
```

###Functors
There are here too! Functor is more a protocol, but also serves as an
interface as well. A class must implement the `fmap` method to fulfill the
protocol or interface.

```python
class FMapDict(dict, Functor):
    def fmap(self, f):
        return FMapDict((k, f(v)) for k,v in self.items())
```

Note: FMapDict is actually implemented at `pynads.concrete.map.Map` as both
a functor and an applicative functor.

Two ways to use!:

```Python
fmd = FMapDict((i,i) for i in range(10))
fmd.fmap(lambda x: x+1)
# or more Haskell-y!
fmap(lambda x: x+1, fmd)
```

I lied, there's three! In Haskell there's `<$>` that serves as an infix fmap.
Of course it'll make an appearance here, too!

```python
(lambda x: x+1) % fmd
```

`%` was chosen because if you squint really hard, ignore the angle brackets,
then `%` and `<$>` kinda look similar.

###Applicatives
We got applicatives as well!

```python
Just(lambda x: x+2).apply(Just(2))
```

But wait, there's an operator!

```python
Just(lambda x: x+2) * Just(2)
```

*Just* like before, take operator overloading to 11!

```python
from random import randint

def bad_get_int():
    x = randint(1,10)
    return x if x%2 else None

add_two = lambda x: lambda y: x+y

t = add_two % bad_get_int() * bad_get_int()
```

Got a curried function (or just a bunch of nested single argument lambdas)?!

```python
fake_curry = lambda x: lambda y: lambda z: x+y+z

multiapply(Just(fake_curry), Just(1), Just(2), Just(3))
```

###Monoids!
Sure, why not. `pynads` has an abstract Monoid base class at
`pynads.abc.monoid.Monoid` (but just `from pynads import Monoid`).

The Monoid abstract base class allows joining together monoids with the `+`
operator (or `sum` or whatever) by defining an `mappend` method which `+`
will delegate to. In addition, the monoid must define an `mempty` value
which represents its "empty" or "zero" value.

This class also provides a default implementation of mconcat which uses
`functools.reduce` and the `mappend` method defined in the instance. However,
this could likely be replaced by `sum` -- considerations for the future.
Subclasses of Monoid are welcome to replace `mconcat` with their own versions.

`pynads` has two monoids: `pynads.List` and `pynads.Map`

##Coming Soon!
Despite this being a toy implementation of Haskell things in Python, I've
taken quite a shine to it. Currently, these are the things in the works:

- State Monad (seems pretty similar to Reader, shouldn't be hard to hammer out)
- do notation (by abusing the coroutine protocol and decorators)
- Expanded notes section so if something seems really odd, you can see my
thought process and the notes I've taken.
- Expanded docstrings on par with Reader's documentation. Despite being a huge
wall of text, I feel it adequately captures my thought process on both
understanding and translating Reader from Haskell to Python.

##Sources
Of course, I didn't come up with this idea on my own. Many implementations
of Haskell-style monads in Python exist. And many sources have informed my
understanding of how each monad operates in Haskell. I doubt I'll list all
of them here as some were found by desperate Google searching and I've
forgotten to record them somewhere.
